(1) what you’ve worked on in the previous two weeks

- I have written the Minimum Requirements, Standard Requirements, and Stretch Requirements sections of the Project Proposal.


(2) what you’ll be working on in the next two weeks

- I will start working on the Front-end of the Application using React/Redux with prioritization on the front ends of the Minimum Requirements specified in the Project Proposal.


(3) where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks.

- I got stuck on coming up with a feasible yet meaningful standard requirements. However, after some discussion with team mates and doing my own research/thinking, I was able to complete this section.
